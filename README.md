# CRC_Algorithm_in_TCP

First of all, thanks to 'https://www.javatpoint.com/crc-program-in-c'

In the above mentioned link, CRC algorithm was implemented without the use of TCP sockets.
This aims to provide CRC algorithm with the implementation of TCP sockets in Unix using C along with dynamic memory allocation to come closer to real - life working.
